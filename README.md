This repository contains the necessary code for building Oneprovider packages.
Oneprovider is part of [Onedata](http://onedata.org) - the global data management system.

## Submodules

The following submodules are used in the repository:



| Submodule | URL      | Description |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Bamboo scripts** | https://github.com/onedata/bamboos | Bamboos is used for automating test deployments in [bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo) during Onedata integration tests. |
| **Cluster Manager** | https://github.com/onedata/cluster-manager | Common Onedata component shared between Onezone and Oneprovider, which monitors and controls Onedata worker processes at site level. |
| **Cluster Worker** | https://github.com/onedata/cluster-worker | Common Onedata worker process implementation, shared between Onezone and Oneprovider. |
| **Oneprovider worker** | https://github.com/onedata/op-worker | Main Oneprovider functional component, based on the **Cluster Worker** framework. |
| **Onepanel** | https://github.com/onedata/onepanel | The Web GUI component |

In order to initialize all submodules please use:
```bash
make submodules
```
instead of directly invoking Git `submodule` commands.

## Building

In order to build oneclient packages and docker images invoke:

```bash
make
```

The building is done in docker containers. The builders docker images are available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/onedata/). 
The build process itself is fully based on Docker containers, so no other prerequisites other than Docker should be necessary. In case of problems with Docker cache, please set `NO_CACHE=1` environment variable.
